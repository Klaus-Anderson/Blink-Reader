# Blink Reader

Blink Reader is an Application for the Android mobile Operating System. The purpose of the Blink Reader
app is to provide its users with an Application for reading text at an enhanced speed. This enhanced
reading speed is achieved by displaying one word of the text which the user is reading at time. By
displaying one word at a time, the user doesn't have to move their eyes, and can manually control
the words per minute at which the text displays.

The inception for Blink Reader was initially conceived of 2019, but was mostly developed during 2020.
Blink Reader is written entirely using Kotlin, and Utilized Android JetPack components including
ViewModel and LiveData.
